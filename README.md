--- by enricotm ----

WordlePy is a program inspired by the famous Wordle game.
However, it consists of 4 different modes.

--- 1. Classic wordle ---

The traditional game of wordle played in your console.


--- 2. Calculate Best Game ---

Calculate the best possible word combination in a game for a given answer, either
starting with a random word or with a predefined list of ones and calculating from there.
It also has a feature of calculating the least amount of tries for each possible answer,
given the first word.


--- 3. Helping You Cheating ---

This is one is pretty unique. Given a certain answer, it gives you a list of words for
every relevant color combination, so you could cheat without getting too suspicious.
Don't be that guy tho.


--- 4. Calculate Word Ranking ---

Similar to calculating the best game, it ranks all the possible words but
this time without knowing the actual answer.
The algorithm is still in progress, but it gives a fairly accurate answer.


--- Notes ---

Most game configurations are directly into the code, without asking for manually input everytime.
So if you are planning on testing it for yourself, keep that in mind.
