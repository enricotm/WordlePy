------------- WordlePy -------------
---
WordlePy is a program inspired by the famous Wordle game, consisted of 4 different game modes.

Classic wordle
---
The traditional game of wordle played in your console.

Calculate Best Game
---
Calculate the best possible word combination in a game for a given answer, either
starting with a random word or with a predefined list and calculating from there.  
It also has a feature of calculating the least amount of tries for each possible answer,
given the first word.

Helping You Cheating
---
This is one is pretty unique. Given a certain answer, it gives you a list of words for
every relevant color combination, so you could cheat without getting too suspicious.
Don't be that guy tho.

Calculate Word Ranking
---
Similar to calculating the best game, it ranks all the possible words but
this time without knowing the actual answer.  
The algorithm is still in progress, but it gives a fairly accurate answer.  

Notes
---
Most game configurations are directly into the code, without asking for manually input everytime.  
So if you are planning on testing it for yourself, keep that in mind.
